# How To Add a New Workout

## Logging in and Starting the Process

To add a new workout to your journal, you must first be logged in to the applicaiton. Once logged in,
you can start the process by clicking the 'Create a Workout' button on the home page or clicking 'New Workout' on the sidebar.

Note: The sidebar is hidden by default on smaller screens. To open the sidebar, click the arrow on the top-left of the screen. Click the arrow again to close the screen, or choose a side bar option to have the screen close automatically.

## Defining the Workout

The first step in the process requires you to provide basic information regarding the workout. Namely: a workout name, a workout date, the type of workout, the workout structure, and any notes about the workouts.

- **Workout Name**: A workout name is required and is set to '[the current date] WOD' by default. The name can be anything you'd like, and does not have to be unique. There is a 100 character limit, however.

- **Workout Date**: A workout date is required and is set as the current date by default. The date can be any time in the past or future, but note that you can not include a time of day.

- **Type of Workout**: Indicating the type of workout is required and is set to 'Strength' by default. The other possible options are 'Conditioning' and 'Skill'. Support for additional workout types will be added in subsequent releases.

- **Workout Structure**: Providing how your workout was structured is required and is set to 'Standard' by default. The workout structure is important as it defines the type of form you will be shown when it comes times to program your workout. There are currently five types of workout structures supported: Standard, EMOM, AMRAP, For Time, and Interval. For more information about adding a particular workout structure, see the workout structure sections below.

- **Workout Notes**: This is an optional field intended to provide any high-level workout information not already captured. Note that there is a 1000 character limit.

Once all data have been set, click 'Program Workout' to move on to the next step.

## Programming the Workout

'Programming' refers to defining the movements and structure of your workout. Programming can be as simple as five sets of five reps, or something more complicated involving work/rest intervals. The application's most fundamental building block is the movement. Every workout has at least one movement. Thus, every workout structure will have the option to add a movement. Fortuntately for users, the process to add a movement is always the same.

### Adding a Movement (Non-interval Workout Structure)

To add a movement, click the 'Add Movement' button.

#### Grouping Movements

A movement can be 'grouped' with the next movement in the workout by checking 'Group with Next Movement'. When a movement is grouped with another, the movement boxes will be connected and the movements will share the same movement number. This feature can be used to combine multiple distinct movements into a single movement (e.g. a complex).

Grouping movements also provides the additional benefit of extending the action functionality to the entire group. For example, clicking clone, move, or delete on a group of movements will clone, move, or delete the entire group rather than the individual movements.

#### Cloning Movements

To facilitate adding similar movements to a workout, you can clone the movement by clicking the blue clipboard button.

#### Moving Movements

To rearrange movements in a workout, you can change the order of the movement by moving it up or down with the corresponding green arrow.

#### Deleting Movements

To delete a movement from a workout, you can click the red trash can icon on the movement.

### Adding a Movement (Interval Workout Structure)

To add a movement to an interval workout structure, you must first add an interval. See 'Adding an Interval' below.

---

### Adding an Interval

The interval workout structure provides an additional building block, the interval, to structure the workout. Intervals can either be defined as 'Work' or 'Rest'. To add a new interval, click the 'Add New Interval' button. Note that movements can only be added to work intervals.

#### Cloning Intervals

To facilitate adding similar intervals to a workout, you can clone the interval by clicking the blue clipboard button.

#### Moving Intervals

To rearrange intervals in a workout, you can change the order of the interval by moving it up or down with the corresponding green arrow.

#### Deleting Intervals

To delete an interval from a workout, you can click the red trash can icon on the interval.

To facilitate data entry, the application shows different programming forms based on the workout structure selected when defining the workout. This ensures you only see fields that pertain to the workout you've done. Below are subsections explaining the different forms and example workouts.
