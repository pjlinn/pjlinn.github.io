## Introduction

Welcome to the PJL Online Fitness Journal user guide. The user guide is broken up in to different 'How To' pages based on the core functionality of the application. At the most fundamental level, there are three actions the application supports:

- Adding Workouts
- Viewing and Editing Workouts
- Viewing Fitness Statistics

As new functionality is added or existing functionality extended, the user guide will be updated accordingly to show users how to take advantage of the updates.
