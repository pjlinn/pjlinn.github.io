# Motivation for Building this Application

## <a id="fitness-journal" name="fitness-journal"></a>What is a fitness journal?

---

Many people keep a written log of their workouts to help plan future workouts, track their progress, feel extra accomplished, or for a litany of other reasons. This written log is often referred to as a 'fitness journal'. Fitness journals are popular because tracking your fitness really is critical for getting the most out of whatever it is you're doing as it allows you to progress in a structured and methodical way.

## <a id="fitness-journal-issues" name="fitness-journal-issues"></a>Why doesn't everyone use a fitness journal?

---

Good question. There are a lot of reasons why people choose not to use a fitness journal, but they all basically boil down to two major drawbacks:

1. **Notebooks are cumbersome -** Carrying around a notebook is annoying, and tracking your work by hand takes valuable persistence you should be saving for your fitness.

2. **Notebooks are low-tech -** Assuming you are diligent enough to keep detailed records of your fitness, you can't ask your notebook questions. Your only recourse is to flip through your notes trying to get the answer you're looking for.

To summarize, it is both difficult to get data _in_ and _out_ of a fitness journal

## <a id="online-fitness-journal" name="online-fitness-journal"></a>What is an online fitness journal?

---

Another good question! An online fitness journal is a high-tech alternative to a traditional fitness journal that allows users to input the same information online that they would ordinarily write down. Ideally, the online fitness journal would address the issues with the traditional fitness journal. Namely that it should be easy to get data _in_ and _out_.

## <a id="differences" name="differences"></a>What separates the PJL online fitness journal from others?

---

The PJL online fitness journal was built from the ground up to specifically address the shortcomings of other online fitness applications. In general, PJL Software's Fitness Journal offers the following:

- **Simplicity** - The UI and UX was meticulously designed to ensure users have the flexibility to add a huge variation of movements and workouts with as little effort as possible.

- **Support Across Devices** - You are not dependent on your phone. The application runs on all modern browsers, which means you can view and edit your journal from any device at any time.

- **Support Across Fitness Domains** - It doesn't matter what type of training you're doing. The application can track workouts for runners, CrossFit-ers, powerlifters, bodybuilders, olympic lifters, you name it!

- **Flexibility** - You can provide as little or as much detail about your workouts as you'd like. The more detail you provide, the better the analytics, but there is no requirement to add more than a workout name and date.
