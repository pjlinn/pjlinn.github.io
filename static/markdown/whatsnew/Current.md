# (2020.02.27) Do you want to get more out of your fitness?

PJL Software has recently launched a closed beta for our [Online Fitness Journal](). We are looking for beta testers to try it out and provide feedback.

Whether you already use an application to help track your workouts, use a traditional workout journal, or don't currently track your fitness at all, we want to hear from you! **Accounts are free** -- all that we ask is that you try it out at least once, and let us know if you like it or hate it.

To get an account: [Request one here](https://fitness.pjlindustries.com)
