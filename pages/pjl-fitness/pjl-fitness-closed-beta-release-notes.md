## Beta Release

The current version of the PJL Fitness Journal is a beta release. This means that the application is stable, but will have issues that need to be resolved. Resolution of such issues could include the permanent loss of user data. PJL will make every attempt to retain user data, but will prioritize fixing critical issues (e.g. security related) over the retention of user data. The site can also go down at any time, for any reason, indefinitely -- by either accident or design. PJL Software reserves the right to permanently remove the website at any time, but we will do our best to notify users beforehand.
