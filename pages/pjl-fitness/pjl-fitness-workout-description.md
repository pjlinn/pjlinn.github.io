## Workout Description

![Image of Auto Workout Description](images/pjl-fitness-workout-description-auto.png)

The ‘Workout Description’ is your workout written out in words and how a workout is represented throughout the application. This page describes the different parts of the workout description.

### Workout Description Components

#### Workout Name

This is the workout name associated with the workout. It was set in the Add Workout Form, and can be changed at any time.

#### Workout Structure Title

This is a special title that describes the structure of your workout and is automatically generated based on the ‘Workout Structure’ selected in the Add Workout Form.

#### Workout Structure

The workout structure represents the order and groupings of movements. This value is either automatically generated by the Add Workout Form or manually entered by the user in the Add Workout Form.

- **Automatically Generated (beta)**: The Add Workout Form has beta functionality that will automatically define a workout structure based on the intervals and movements entered. The automatically generated workout structure is always available and is the default workout structure used unless the user selects ‘Write Your Own’.

  The intention of this feature is to save the user time by creating either an adequate workout structure that can be used as-is, or the start of a workout structure that can be used as a jumping off point. PJL estimates that at least 80% of workouts can be captured automatically. For the remaining workouts, users can manually enter the workout structure.

- **Manually Generated**: Users can write their own workout structure or copy and paste a workout from an external source by clicking ‘Write Your Own’. From here, users can enter any text that will be shown as the workout structure throughout the application. To get back to the automatically generated workout structure, users can click ‘Use Ours’.

Users can copy either workout structure to their clipboard using the copy button in the workout description header.
